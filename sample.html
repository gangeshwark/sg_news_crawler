    <p>Contact tracing is underway for the other seven locally transmitted cases, including those confirmed
        today, to establish if they are linked to previous cases or persons with travel history to mainland
        China.</p>
    <h2>Three known clusters</h2>
    <p>MOH, with the help of the Singapore Police Force, has identified three known clusters:</p>
    <ol>
